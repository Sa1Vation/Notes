# BTH 006 Final Review
## Product Vision
Reading: Book1 sections 1, 3, 4, 6.2, 7.3.1, and 7.5.3.

### Theory

- ##### Requirements engineering process

1. Elicitation

   Gather stakeholder needs and constraints

2. Analysis

   Design options that may turn needs and constraints into agreed requirements

3. Validation

   Implementation proposals for the software are being tried

   e.g. by experiencing prototypes with the stakeholders

4. Specification 

   Document elicitation and analysis results, including the prototype in requirement specification

- ##### Important requirements engineering concepts

1. Assumptions - Introspection by the requirements engineer

2. Ideas - creativity by the development team

3. Needs - the analysis of viewpoints

4. Goals

5. Requirements - a handshake between the stakeholders representing the viewpoints and the development team

   1. a condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or

      achieve an objective,

   2. a condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or

      system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other

      formally imposed documents,

   3. a documented representation of a condition or capability as in (1) or

      (2).

* ##### The most important factors of success project

  1. Clear Vision + Objectives
  2. Ownership
  3. Realistic Expectations
  4. Clear requirements
  5. Management support
  6. User involvement

### Techniques

- ##### Release planning with story map

- ##### Creativity techniques

  1. Brainstorming Tech. ( to generate lots of ideas )

  Divergence

  1. 6-3-5 Brainwriting Tech. ( to generate 108 ideas in 30 minutes )
  2. Brainstorming Paradox Tech. ( to think about the error may be occurred )
  3. Analogy Tech. ( to generate an idea from existed idea )

  Convergence

  1. Idea evaluation checklists ( to determine the value of idea, e.g. Impressiveness, Knowledge, Value maximization, Problem minimization)
  2. Change of Perspectives: Six Thinking Hats Technique

- ##### Market research

- ##### Technology research

### Product Vision

- ##### Ideas

- ##### Vision statement

  - Why is the new product needed? ( Who need? Why need? How important? What is the goal to solve problem? )
  - What will the new product be? ( Users? How to use? Product name? Technologies of product? Key features/functions? )
  - What is exactly new with the product? ( Unlike others? Unique values?)

### Requirements specification

- ##### Story map

- ##### Backlog

## User Needs

Reading: Book sections 6.2, 7.3.1, 7.5.3, and 7.5.5.

### Theory

- ##### Goal reasoning

  - argue that users will achieve goals with software (capabilities)
  - Capability <---> Goal

- ##### Process reasoning

  - Assign to the software-to-be, people, and external systems
  - Assist us in the solution design
  - 4 Process type:
    - Linear process
    - Iterative process
    - Process Variants
    - Collaboration

- ##### Requirements quality: content

### Techniques

- ##### Contextual inquiry (elicitation techniques) ( to find out whom and how  to interact with software )

  - Workshop
  - Interview
  - Questionnaire-based Survey
  - Introspection
  - Observation
  - Archaeology
  - Document Analysis
  - Reuse
  - Data Mining

- ##### System archaeology - A technique of contextual inquiry

- ##### Sampling

- ##### Storyboard

  - Storyboards are a sequence of steps performed by humans or systems followed to achieve a goal ( in comic way ).

- ##### Walkthrough with prototype

### Supporting techniques

- ##### Value proposition canvas

- ##### Moodboard

  - A moodboard is literally a board (digital or material) which people filled  with different  kinds  of  things  from  photos  to  various  textures  so  that  they could  visualize  ideas  and  concepts.
  - Mood  boards are  meant  to  transfer  the  right mood and bring the emotions expected from a product.

### Product Vision

- ##### Storyboard

  - Describe how the software to achieve its goal

- ##### Prototype

  - Aprproximate the user interface of app.

### Requirements specification

- ##### Feature specifications

### Stakeholder agreement

- ##### User viewpoints

- ##### External systems viewpoints

## Requirements Specification

### Theory

* ##### Smells for bad formulations

* ##### HCI in requirements specification

* ##### Model theory

* ##### Requirements quality: documentation

* ##### Domain models

## Stakeholder Agreement

### Theory

* ##### Quality-impact reasoning with QUPER

* ##### Nature of win-win negotiations

* ##### Pre-requirements traceability

* ##### Post-requirements traceability

* ##### Requirements-impact reasoning with Kano model

* ##### Requirements quality: agreement

## Statements

### Product Vision

* Problem statement

The problem of (what)... affects (who)... with the impact (what)...

A successful solution (how to and how much)...

* Solution concept

For ... who ... the ... is a / uses ... for ...

* Differentiating innovation

Unlike ... the/this product allows ...
