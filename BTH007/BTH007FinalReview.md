## Introduction to GSE

### Project context

- What - Type of work
- When - Software life cycle
- Where - Destination
- How - Type of collaboration

### Organizational collaboration forms

### Critical factors that alleviate transfers

- Product
- People
- Process

### Key challenges of transfer

- Responsibility distribution
- Integration
- Efficiency
- Lack of flexibility
- Coordination and communication complexity
- Disparities (uneven) in work approaches

### Negative impact of transfers

- Loss of knowledge within the product
- Temporary productivity decrease
- Initial reduction in scope of delivery
- Temporal decrease in quality
- Growing product entropy/complexity; technical degradation
- Lack of co-located expertise of all system’s domains
- Prolongation of experts from original site for solving difficult problems
- Demands of more detailed requirements specification

### Transfer models

- Phase-based model - most popular model
- Customization model
- Modularization model
- Distributed model
- Follow-the-sun model

### Integration problems

## Benefits of outsourcing

### GSE Pros & Cons

- GSE pros:
  - Reduced development costs
  - Leveraging time zone effectiveness
  - Access to large skilled labor pool
  - Closer proximity to market and customer
  - Innovation and shared best practice
  - Improved resource allocation
- GSE cons:
  - Loss of knowledge within the product
  - Temporary productivity decrease
  - Initial reduction in scope of delivery
  - Temporal decrease in quality
  - Growing product entropy/complexity; technical degradation
  - Lack of co-located expertise of all system’s domains
  - Prolongation of experts from original site for solving difficult problems
  - Demands of more detailed requirements specification

### Achieving the benefits: Cost

- What value we pay for:
  - release productivity
  - years of experience
  - quality level 
  - response times
  - innovative capacity
  - flexibility
  - stability
  - proximity to customers

### Achieving the benefits: Speed

- Timezone effectiveness:
  - Suitable for independent work (e.g. separate modules, stand-alone tasks, testing, bug fixing)
  - Major challenge – reliance on asynchronous communication when feedback is crucial
  - Measured NOT through time zone difference, but through the amount of overlapping working hours

### Achieving the benefits: Skills

- Difficult to obtain:
  - Technical knowledge
  - Domain knowledge
  - Similar knowledge about software development
- Additional challenge: training people to take over an existing product to continue the on-going development

### Closer proximity to market and customer

- Proximity to customers may increase the knowledge of the local market
- Creating new jobs can create good will with local customers, possibly resulting in more contracts

### Achieving the benefits: innovation and shared best practice

- Challenges:
  - Collaboration of team members who come from different national and organizational backgrounds
  - Collaboration between competitors
  - Collaboration between people who perceive that their counterparts are “stealing” their jobs
- Related topics: trust, fears
- This benefit, if expected, requires a different strategy
  - “Knowledge seekers” approach
  - Talent around the world is expensive

## Project Management and Coordination in GSE

### What is a project?

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to  create a unique product or service.

### Major challenges - 3C

- Coordination
  - Diversity in ways of working
  - Lack of joint processes and tools
  - Poor coordination of tasks across locations
  - Lack of or poor understanding of requirements
- Communication
  - Trust
  - Language barriers
  - Culture barriers
  - Asychronouse work
  - Lack of cohesiveness
  - Knowledge and information sharing barriers
- Control
  - Lack of process transparency
  - Lack of progress visibility

### Coordinating mechanisms

- Standardization
- Direct supervision
- Mutual adjustment

## Cultural management 

### What is culture?

Culture is a set of shared experiences, understandings, and meanings among members of a group, an organization, a community, or a nation.

### Building blocks of culture

- values, including preferences people use to make work- related and communication related decisions in projects
- practices, including cultural norms for adopting specific project management styles and organization structures

### Cultural dimensions - Hofstede’s work

1. Power distance - how a society handles inequalities
2. Individualism/collectivism - behavior towards the group
3. Masculinity/femininity - behavior according to gender
4. Uncertainty avoidance - the need for structure
5. Long term orientation - value of long-standing traditions

## Global teamwork

Team performance

only in a team

### BIG 5 of teamwork

1. Team Leadership
2. Mutual performance monitoring
3. Backup behavior
4. Adapbility
5. Team orientation

### Coordinating mechanisms

1. Shared mental models
2. Mutual trust
3. Closed-loop communication

A global software team is a team whose members collaborate on a common software project while working across geographic, temporal, cultural, and relational boundaries to accomplish an interdependent task

This is also a virtual team
