## Intro

### Norman's Intereaction Model

Goals -> Intention -> Action Specification -> Execution -> Perception -> Interpretation -> Evalution

- The differences between goals and intentions
  - Goals are focused on the future. Intentions are in the present moment.
  - Goals are a destination or specific achievement. Intentions are lived each day, independent of achieving the goal or destination.
  - Goals are external achievements. Intentions are about your relationship with yourself and others.

首先，用户形成目标。这是用户对需要做什么的想法，并且是按照任务语言中的领域来构建的。它可能不精确，因此在用户执行之前，需要转化为更具体的意图，以及达到目标的实际行动。在执行动作序列之后，用户感知到了系统的新状态，并根据他的期望来理解它。如果系统状态反映了用户的目标，那么计算机已经完成了他想要的工作，并且交互已经成功；否则，用户必须制定新的目标并重复该循环。

诺曼用简单的开灯的例子来说明这个循环：

> 当夜幕降临时，你正坐着看书。你确立目标：获得更多光。于是，你形成了打开台灯的意图，并且你指定了需要的动作 - 接近到并按下台灯开关。如果其他人离台灯更近，意图可能会不同——你可以要求他们为你开灯。你的目标是一样的，但是意图和行动是不同的。当你已经执行了你感知到结果的动作时，无论灯是亮着还是关着，你会根据你对世界的了解来解释这些。
> 例如，如果灯不亮，你可能会将此解释为灯泡已经熄灭或者灯没有插上电源，你会制定新的目标来解决这个问题。
> 如果灯亮了，你会根据最初的目标来评估新的状态——现在有足够的灯吗？如果是这样，循环就完成了。如果没有，你可以制定一个新的意图来打开主顶灯。

### Activity Theory Model

| Physical activity | Mental activity | By asking   |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| activity          | motive          | Why to get  |
| action            | goal            | What to get |
| operation         | condition       | How to get  |

5. Knowledge categories and properties of learning and presentations

   1. Knowledge categories

      - Experience
      - Production rule
      - Distributed network
      - Recall and recognition
      - Context

      

      - Semantic knowledge: mostly are in form of concept, general fact, statement, judgement.
      - Episodic knowledge: mostly are in form of personal experience, time and location specified.
      - Semantic network: with nodes for various concepts and links activation.

      

   2. Properties of presentations

      - Prepositional, Pictorial, and Auditory

6. Cognitive Communication models and the classical Communication model in the real world.

   1. Classical (Shannon's) Communication model![Screen Shot 2021-01-16 at 8.32.54 PM](https://gitee.com/Sa1vation/my-pic-bed/raw/master/typora_imgs/20210628150614.png)

   - Consistency
   - Clarity
   - Aesthetics
   - Feedback
   - Forgiveness
   - Awareness of human strengths and limitations
   - Allow quick way for experienced user
   - Provide navigation support (home, back, bookmark, etc.)
   - Special action should be noticed with special sound, colour, blink.
   - Do not use more than four different kinds of colour in your system.
   - Use colour as information (red: warning, green: ok)
   - Use white-black interface first
   - ……

8. 4 different types of interactive systems and their design focuses.

   1. Life-Critical systems
   2. Industrial and commercial uses
   3. Office, home, and entertainment
   4. Explorative, strategic, creative, and co-operative systems

    - Learnability: pick novice users of system, measure time to perform certain tasks. 
    - Efficiency: pick expert users, measure time to perform typical tasks. 
    - Memorability: pick casual users (away from system for certain time), measure time to perform typical tasks. 
    - Errors: count minor and catastrophic errors made by users while performing some specified task. 
    - Satisfaction: ask users' subjective opinion (questionnaire, interview), after using system for important tasks. 

15. Some (10) heuristics for interaction design 

    1. Visibility of system status 

       - inform users about what is going on within reasonable time. 
    2. Match between system and the real world 

       - speak the users' language, 
       - Follow real-world conventions, 
    3. User control and freedom 

       - "emergency exit" 
       - Support undo and redo. 
    4. Consistency and standards 

       - Consistency within users, and systems
       - Follow platform conventions. 
    5. Error prevention 

       - Error free
       - good error messages 
    6. Recognition rather than recall 

       - Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
       - The user should not have to remember information . 
    7. Flexibility and efficiency of use

       - Accelerators for the expert user 
       - Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 
    8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 

       - Professional design
       - no irrelevant information 
    9. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors 

       - Error messages in plain language (no codes), 
       - suggest a solution. 
    10. Help and documentation 
        - easy to search help information 
        - On line (balloon)
